Constantly jumping into diverse and unfamiliar experiences, I am an autodidactic self-starter who is driven to achieve success in my work. Having worked in 3 different countries since graduating college in 2010, one of my best qualities is that I have the proven ability to work extremely well with all personality types and adapt to any environment. My considerable history of professional experience alongside my education in business and foreign languages have both refined not only my intellectual faculties of analytical thinking and communication but have also supplied me with a core knowledge of finance, accounting, marketing, operations, human resources and a pragmatic acumen to be able to accomplish difficult tasks and meet short deadlines in any setting.

Our unique sales effectiveness platform includes proposal automation, content libraries, playbooks and analytics and has improved win-rates and productivity for some of the world’s most successful corporations.

I'm looking for introductions to senior executives involved in sales and proposal creation in large companies in the US, UK and Europe.

► HOW I CAN HELP YOU:

•	Sales effectiveness
•	Sales strategy
•	Bid and proposal management
•	Sales operations

I work with corporations seeking new ways to improve sales effectiveness and unlock existing sales investments. By demonstrating the positive impact on my own sales activities, it’s easy for other sales professionals to relate to our solutions.

For example, in a recent meeting I was asked to send a proposal “whenever”, which was not very encouraging! While traveling home, I created the proposal on-line and it was with the client within the hour.

The client called me back and said, “WOW, now we get it!”

That’s one aspect of the Qvidian platform; it allows you to create personalized and compelling sales documents and deliver them quickly.....AND we won the deal, by the way.

► WHAT QVIDIAN PROVIDES:

•	Situational coaching & guidance – reinforce sales methodology & makes faster wins
•	Precision sales forecasting – improve forecast accuracy, increase deal sizes & up-sell opportunities
•	Creates winning proposals – persuasive & client focused
•	Compelling content – quickly locates relevant data and content for your audience

Please Don't call me. I don't have time to discuss. So my pain is pretty simple. We had forms that created dupes because of a sales ops process issue and we fixed it. Now I have a ton of dupes I need cleaned up.

I just want a pricing breakdown for identifying and merging existing duplicates.

4/10/13 - SPoke to Mike and there is no progress. I grilled him to get me a chance and he said to call back beginning of May.

4/8/13 - LM and Emailed

1/25/13 - Spoke to Mike and Broadlook is far off, but UE could be something he recommends to his CEO for top 5 upgrades to SF. He said second or 3rd quarter.

1/22/12 - Spoke to Mike and he was busy. Told me to get back to him on Friday to go over prevent and broadlook tools. 1:50PM

1/10/13 - LM and emailed

12/13/12 - Lost deal to CRM Fusion. They wanted us to customize and then found a solution before we could make it happen. I pitched on preventative tools and he was interested in them later on. They did not sign for CRM Fusion's preventative tools. I then pitched on broadlook and he will be going to their demo wall. He may also sign up for a demo... Let Daniel know. He became very interested in broadlook because of normalization and the ability to map markets instead of using SIC codes. He could never find the target markets he was looking for using Data.com!!! Call early January to start preventing dupes. Maybe they haven't used CRM fusion and we can pitch simplicity of our solution.

12/12/12 - Set up new case and chattered Matt/Steve.  If no word, not sure what to do. He needs logic on DC customized.

12/12/12 - Steve would like me to set up a meeting to discuss this change!!!

12/10/12 - Mike requested logic change for DC via email.  I forwarded to Matt and am waiting on response.  If we are able to do this, it should lock in a big deal!  See if Matt has gotten back to him and if not, expedite the process.

12/8/12 - Couple hundred users and integrating with SAP. Biggest group just came through with 42000 scanned business cards to upload.

CRM Fusion, RingLead and CloudDingo....

Told him differences and he will choose between the two.

Follow up this time next week. 12:30 Wednesday.
